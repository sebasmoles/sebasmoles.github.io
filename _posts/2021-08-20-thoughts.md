- What I am truly thinking is how hard is programming and how being a software developer is so broken: lots of stuff to learn, hard to get an entry-level position, new technologies coming out every week, "bugs", and so forth. There are no formats or frameworks for those, I think.<br><br>

- Sometimes I ask myself, "Is this for me?" "Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life?" Tricky questions for sure, yet common. We just have to accept frustration and other uncomfortable/hard feelings, allowing ourselves to feel them.<br><br>

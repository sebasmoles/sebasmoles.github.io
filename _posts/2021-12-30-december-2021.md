## [#](#intro-amazon-s3){: #intro-amazon-s3} Intro to Amazon S3

I have been working on my [recipes project](https://github.com/sebasmoles/recipes-web-app){:target="\_blank"} the last few weeks, and it's been a great exercise for a better understanding of Vue.js and other related technologies.

Now, I am facing a reality that I knew will come someday: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

I need a storage service for the images that users upload from the client and access to them afterwards, so that I can display them when requested. Given that need, I found out that one of my best options out there (quality/price) was in fact: [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/){:target="\_blank"}.

Make sure to explore the final result of the recipes project [here](https://recipes-web-app-project.herokuapp.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

## [#](#cors){: #cors } CORS

Yesterday, I faced a [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing){:target="\_blank"} (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) related problem. I got this error:

I didn’t know how to solve it, neither if it was a backend or a frontend problem. Turns out it is a quite common error among new web developers.

The way you fix it is in the server. You have to tell your server which origins should be allowed. For that purpose, simply install a node package called [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors){:target="\_blank"} (follow the official documentation).

Yeah…welcome to backend!

## [#](#random-concepts){: #random-concepts } Random concepts

Below some programming concepts that I wanted to define in my own words:

-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism
-   Server-side rendering: I have an excellent analogy for SSR understanding.
-   MVC pattern

## [#](#getting-started-node-js){: #getting-started-node-js } Getting started with Node.js

I started to learn [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target="\_blank"} (no frameworks) this week. Here are some definitions/ideas that I consider key: (Defined in my own words)

-   Node.js is not a language, is a JavaScript [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system){:target="\_blank"}.
-   [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target="\_blank"} stands for “Node Package Manager”. You get it by default when you download node.
-   Modules (aka libraries) are just JavaScript files that have an export.
-   `__dirname` and `__filename` are always-available variables within every module.
-   Middleware functions are modules that allow code abstraction for callbacks and validations.
-   Callbacks are functions that are passed in as arguments to other functions and are executed at a conditional given time. Any function can become a callback.

Some additional useful tips:

-   The [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon){:target="\_blank"} dependency is a practical tool for updating the changes we make in our code without restarting the server.

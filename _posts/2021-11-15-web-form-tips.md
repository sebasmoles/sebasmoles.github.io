The purpose of these is to help your users understand more the structure of your web forms, and as a result, get you more quality data with the due format and fewer mistakes.<br><br>

Apply them as you wish, and keep in mind that exceptions to these “rules” may exist.<br><br>

1. Make the input background constrast when the element is focused. 
2. Use labels outside the fields and avoid placeholders.
3. Divide fields into semantic groups.
4. Have a visual constraint.
5. Mark optional fields instead of mandatory.
6. Use input constraints for each field.
7. Be clear in your error messages.

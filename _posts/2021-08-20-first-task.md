I wanted to write about my first task as a data analyst, but when I started the article it felt inappropriate, out of place, and dishonest.<br><br>

What I was truly thinking at the moment was how hard is programming and how being a software developer is so broken: lots of stuff to learn, hard to get an entry-level position, new technologies coming out every week, "bugs", and so forth. <br><br>

"There are no formats or frameworks for those," I thought.<br><br>

Sometimes I ask myself, "Is this for me?" "Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life?"<br><br>

Tricky questions for sure, yet common. Sometimes we just have to accept frustration and other uncomfortable/hard feelings, allowing ourselves to feel them.<br><br>


I feel way better now thanks to accomplishing with success my first task, though. Thanks to writing this.
